                            For the Live Streaming presentation, it is silently ignored and applied when the presentation ends and the stream becomes VoD. This is a long value that represents an absolute end point of the presentation, rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes. Use start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.

                            This value defines the latest live position that a client can seek to. Using this property, you can delay live playback position and create a server-side buffer for players. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds. The maximum live back off duration is 300 seconds. For example, a value of 20 means that the latest available content is 20 seconds delayed from the real live edge.

                            that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example,

                            For the Live Streaming presentation, it is silently ignored and applied when the presentation ends and the stream becomes VoD. This is a long value that represents an absolute end point of the presentation, rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes. Use start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.

Using this property, you can delay live playback position and create a server-side buffer for players. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds. The maximum live back off duration is 300 seconds. For example, a value of 20 means that the latest available content is 20 seconds delayed from the real live edge.

                            that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example,

                            For the Live Streaming presentation, it is silently ignored and applied when the presentation ends and the stream becomes VoD. This is a long value that represents an absolute end point of the presentation, rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes. Use start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation.

The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes.

For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation.

                          in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments

This is a long value that represents an absolute end point of the presentation, rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes. Use start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.

This is a long value that represents an absolute end point of the presentation, rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units of 180 would be for 3 minutes. Use start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example, start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.

The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds. The maximum live back off duration is 300 seconds.
