                            it is silently ignored and applied when the presentation
                            ends and the stream becomes VoD. This is a long value

                            rounded to the closest next GOP start. The unit is defined
                            by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds, so an end_in_units

                            in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments
                            from between 20 seconds and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation.
                            If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment

                            The maximum live back off duration is 300 seconds. For
                            example, a value of 20 means that the latest available
                            content is 20 seconds delayed from the real live edge.

                            playlist. The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds.
                            For example, set presentation_window_in_units to 120 to
                            apply a two-minute sliding window. Media within 2 minutes
                            of the live edge will be included in the playlist. If

                            will be included in the playlist. The minimum presentation

                            The unit is defined by unit_timescale_in_milliseconds,
                            so a start_in_units of 15 would be for 15 seconds. Use
                            start_in_units and end_in_units to trim the fragments
                            that will be in the playlist (manifest). For example,
                            start_in_units set to 20 and end_in_units set to 60 using
                            unit_timescale_in_milliseconds in 1000 will generate a

                            and 60 seconds of the VoD presentation. If a fragment

                            Or if you want to set start_in_units in 30 milliseconds,

                            in 1000 will generate a playlist that contains fragments
