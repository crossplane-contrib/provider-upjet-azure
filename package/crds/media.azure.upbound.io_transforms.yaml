                                  or StandardDefinition. Specifies the maximum resolution
                                  at which your video is analyzed. The default behavior
                                  is SourceResolution which will keep the input video
                                  at its original resolution when analyzed. Using
                                  StandardDefinition will resize input videos to standard
                                  definition while preserving the appropriate aspect
                                  ratio. It will only resize if the video is of higher
                                  resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would
                                  be scaled to 640x360 before processing. Switching
                                  to StandardDefinition will reduce the time it takes
                                  to process high resolution video. It may also reduce

                                  will choose the first language detected and process
                                  with the selected language for the duration of the
                                  file. It does not currently support dynamically
                                  switching between languages after the first language
                                  is detected. The automatic detection works best
                                  with audio recordings with clearly discernible speech.
                                  If automatic detection fails to find the language,
                                  transcription would fallback to ''en-US''." The

                                  audio only, then only audio insights are generated.
                                  Similarly if the input is video only, then only
                                  video insights are generated. It is recommended
                                  that you not use AudioInsightsOnly if you expect

                description: WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace
                  and name of a Secret to which any connection details for this managed
                  resource should be written. Connection details frequently include
                  the endpoint, username, and password required to connect to the
                  managed resource. This field is planned to be replaced in a future
                  release in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both
                  could be set independently and connection details would be published
                  to both without affecting each other.
