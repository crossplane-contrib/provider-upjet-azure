                                  resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would
                                  be scaled to 640x360 before processing. Switching

                                  to process high resolution video. It may also reduce

                                  are AudioInsightsOnly, VideoInsightsOnly, and AllInsights.
                                  If you set this to AllInsights and the input is
                                  audio only, then only audio insights are generated.
                                  Similarly if the input is video only, then only
                                  video insights are generated. It is recommended
                                  that you not use AudioInsightsOnly if you expect
                                  some of your inputs to be video only; or use VideoInsightsOnly
                                  if you expect some of your inputs to be audio only.
                                  Your Jobs in such conditions would error out.
